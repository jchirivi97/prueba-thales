## **üìå Application Requirements**  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Project Setup**  
- The application must be structured following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern**.  
- The backend must be implemented using **Spring Boot**, **JSF**, **Struts**, or **Vaadin**.  
- The final application must be packaged as a **WAR file**.  
- It must be **deployable on Wildfly Server** or **Spring Boot's embedded container**.  
- Requires **JDK 1.8+**.  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Access Layer**  
- The application must consume the following **REST APIs**:  
  - Get all employees: `http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employees`  
  - Get an employee by ID: `http://dummy.restapiexample.com/api/v1/employee/{id}`  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic Layer**  
- A business class (e.g., **EJB**) must compute the **annual salary** of an employee using:
